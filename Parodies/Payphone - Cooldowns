I'm out of cooldowns trying to play ranked
All of my cards are wasted too
where has my team gone, baby it's all wrong
How did I get this dark doubloon?

Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember...
How to play in this game,
It's even harder to look back,
And see the absence of fame

They say it's too late to go pro,
But is it too late to try,
And in that time that we've wasted,
All of our funds have run dry

I've wasted my gold,
or so I've been told,
Now I'm broke as fuck,
Still stuck with this buck,
haven't play any' else,
but even the suns sets for pro players.

I'm out of cooldowns trying to play ranked
ALl of my team has gone A-woll
where is this 'nessa, baby it's all wrong
where are the plans we made in fall

If four-0 wins really did exist,
I would still carry you like I did,
all those other pros are full of shit,
one more three-four loss and I'll be sick...

you turned you back on your team,
'cause you forgot how to play.
I gave you my skills to borrow,
but they just faded away.

You can't expect me to retry,
I don't expect you to care.
I know I've said it before but,
All of our funds have run dry.

I've wasted my gold,
or so I've been told,
Now I'm broke as fuck,
Still stuck with this buck,
haven't play any' else,
but even the suns sets for pro players.

I'm out of cooldowns trying to play ranked
All of my cards are wasted too

How did I get this dark doubloon?

I would still carry you like I did,
all those other pros are full of shit,
one more three-four loss and I'll be sick...

Now I'm out of cooldowns...
